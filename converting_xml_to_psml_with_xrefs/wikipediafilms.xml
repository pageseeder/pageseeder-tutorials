		<summary>
			<p>Annie Hall is a 1977 American romantic comedy film directed by <writer>
					<name sort="Allen, Woody">Woody Allen</name>
				</writer> from a screenplay he co-wrote with <writer>
					<name sort="Brickman, Marshall">Marshall Brickman</name>
				</writer>. Produced by Allen's manager,  <producer>
					<name sort="Joffe, Charles H.">Charles H. Joffe</name>
				</producer>, the film stars the director as Alvy "Max" Singer, who tries to figure out the reasons for the failure of his relationship with the film's eponymous female lead, played by <actor><name sort="Keaton, Diane">Diane Keaton</name></actor> in a role written specifically for her.</p>
			<p>Principal photography for the film began on May 19, 1976 on the South Fork of Long Island, and filming continued periodically for the next ten months. Allen has described the result, which marked his first collaboration with cinematographer Gordon Willis, as "a major turning point", in that unlike the farces and comedies that were his work to that point, it introduced a new level of seriousness. Academics have noted the contrast in the settings of New York City and Los Angeles, the stereotype of gender differences in sexuality, the presentation of Jewish identity, and the elements of psychoanalysis and modernism.</p>
			<p>Annie Hall was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival in March 1977, before its official release on April 20, 1977. The film received widespread critical acclaim, and along with winning the Academy Award for Best Picture, it received Oscars in three other categories: two for Allen (Best Director and, with Brickman, Best Original Screenplay), and Keaton for Best Actress. The film additionally won four BAFTA awards and a Golden Globe, the latter being awarded to Keaton. Its North American box office receipts of $38,251,425 are fourth-best in the director's oeuvre when not adjusted for inflation. Often listed among the greatest film comedies, it ranks 31st on AFI's list of the top feature films in American cinema, fourth on their list of top comedy films and number 28 on Bravo's "100 Funniest Movies." Film critic Roger Ebert called it "just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie". The film has been named the funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of the "101 Funniest Screenplays."</p>

			<p>Brazil is a 1985 dystopian science fiction film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by <writer><name sort="Gillam, Terry">Gilliam</name></writer>, <writer><name sort="McKeown, Charles">Charles McKeown</name></writer>, and <writer><name sort="Stoppard, Tom">Tom Stoppard</name></writer>.

			<p>The film centres on Sam Lowry, a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living a life in a small apartment, set in a consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines. Brazil's bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of the government depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, except that it has a buffoonish, slapstick quality and lacks a Big Brother figure.</p>
			<p>Jack Mathews, film critic and author of The Battle of Brazil (1987), described the film as "satirizing the bureaucratic, largely dysfunctional industrial world that had been driving Gilliam crazy all his life". Though a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North America release. It has since become a cult film. In Brazil, some local movie critics believe it intended to make a satirical portrait on the Brazilian military government which was about to end on its release date.</p>
			<p>The film is named after the recurrent theme song, Ary Barroso's "Aquarela do Brasil", as performed by Geoff Muldaur.</p>

		<summary>
			<p>Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-author, director and star. The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by <writer><name sort="Mankiewicz, Herman J.">Herman J. Mankiewicz</name></writer> and <writer><name sort="Welles, Orson">Welles</name></writer>. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the greatest film ever made, Citizen Kane was voted the greatest film of all time in five consecutive Sight and Sound polls of critics, until it was displaced by Vertigo in the 2012 poll. It topped the American Film Institute's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998, as well as AFI's 2007 update. Citizen Kane is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, and narrative structure, which were innovative for its time.</p>
			<p>The story is a film that examines the life and legacy of Charles Foster Kane, played by <actor><name sort="Welles, Orson">Orson Welles</name></actor>, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Chicago tycoons Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of Welles's own life. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through flashbacks, the story is told through the research of a newsreel reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud".</p>
			<p>After the Broadway successes of Welles's Mercury Theatre and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast "The War of the Worlds" on The Mercury Theatre on the Air, Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with RKO Pictures in 1939. Unusual for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have final cut privilege. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the screenplay for Citizen Kane, collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.</p>
			<p>While a critical success, Citizen Kane failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as Andre Bazin and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.</p>

			<p>Ed Wood is a 1994 American period comedy-drama biopic directed and produced by Tim Burton, and starring <actor><name sort="Depp, Johnny">Johnny Depp</name></actor> as cult filmmaker Ed Wood.

			<p>The film was conceived by writers <writer><name sort="Alexander, Scott">Scott Alexander</name></writer> and <writer><name sort="Karaszewski, Larry">Larry Karaszewski</name></writer> when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films with their work on Problem Child and its sequel, Alexander and Karaszewski struck a deal with Burton and Denise Di Novi to produce the Ed Wood biopic, and Michael Lehmann as director. Due to scheduling conflicts with Airheads, Lehmann had to vacate the director's position, which was taken over by Burton.</p>
			<p>Ed Wood was originally in development at Columbia Pictures, but the studio put the film in 'turnaround' over Burton's decision to shoot in black-and-white. Ed Wood was taken to the Walt Disney Studios, which produced the film through the studio's Touchstone Pictures division. The film was released to huge critical acclaim, but it would prove to be a box office disappointment, making only $5.9 million against an $18 million budget. It won two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor for Landau and Best Makeup for Rick Baker (who designed Landau's prosthetic makeup), Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng.</p>

		<summary>
			<p>Jaws is a 1975 American film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on <writer><name sort="Benchley, Peter">Peter Benchley</name></writer>'s 1974 novel Jaws. The prototypical summer blockbuster, its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it with the help of a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter. The film stars <actor><name sort="Scheider, Roy">Roy Scheider</name></actor> as police chief Martin Brody, <actor><name sort="Dreyfuss, Richard">Richard Dreyfuss</name></actor> as oceanographer Matt Hooper, <actor><name sort="Shaw, Robert">Robert Shaw</name></actor> as shark hunter Quint, <actor><name sort="Hamilton, Murray">Murray Hamilton</name></actor> as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and <actor><name sort="Gary, Lorraine">Lorraine Gary</name></actor> as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer <writer><name sort="Gottlieb, Carl">Carl Gottlieb</name></writer>, who rewrote the script during principal photography.</p>
			<p>Shot mostly on location on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, employing an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer John Williams to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures gave the film what was then an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.</p>
			<p>Generally well received by critics, Jaws became the highest-grossing film of all time until Star Wars. It won several awards for its soundtrack and editing. Along with Star Wars, Jaws was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which revolves around high box-office returns from action and adventure pictures with simple "high-concept" premises that are released during the summer in thousands of theaters and supported by heavy advertising. It was followed by three sequels, none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, Jaws was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>

It stars <actor><name sort="De Niro, Robert">Robert De Niro</name></actor> as Jake LaMotta, an Italian American middleweight boxer whose self-destructive and obsessive rage, sexual jealousy, and animalistic appetite destroyed his relationship with his wife and family. Also featured in the film are <actor><name sort="Pesci, Joey">Joe Pesci</name></actor> as Joey, La Motta's well-intentioned brother and manager who tries to help Jake battle his inner demons, and <actor><name sort="Moriarty, Cathy">Cathy Moriarty</name></actor> as his wife.

			<p>Scorsese was initially reluctant to develop the project, though he eventually came to relate to La Motta's story. Schrader re-wrote Martin's first screenplay, and Scorsese and De Niro together made uncredited contributions thereafter. Pesci was an unknown actor prior to the film, as was Moriarty, who was suggested for her role by Pesci. During principal photography, each of the boxing scenes was choreographed for a specific visual style and De Niro gained approximately 60 pounds (27 kg) to portray La Motta in his later post-boxing years. Scorsese was exacting in the process of editing and mixing the film, expecting it to be his last major feature[citation needed].</p>
			<p>After receiving mixed initial reviews (and criticism due to its violent content), it went on to garner a high critical reputation and is now regarded among the greatest American films ever made, including by Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune, British film historian Leslie Halliwell, the American Film Institute, Time, The New York Times, Variety, Entertainment Weekly, Empire, Total Film, Film 4, and BFI's Sight and Sound. It was listed in the National Film Registry in 1990, its first year of eligibility. Raging Bull is voted by many critics including Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel as the best film of the 1980s. The film is now regarded by many to be Scorsese's magnum opus.</p>

		<summary>
			<p>Solaris (Russian: ???????, tr. Solyaris) is a 1972 Russian science fiction art film adaptation of Polish author Stanislaw Lem's novel Solaris (1961). The film was co-written and directed by <writer><name sort="Tarkovsky, Andrei">Andrei Tarkovsky</name></writer>.[2][3] The film is a meditative psychological drama occurring mostly aboard a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris. The scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into separate emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin travels to the Solaris space station to evaluate the situation only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others.</p>
			<p>The original science fiction novel is about the ultimate inadequacy of communication between humans and other species. Tarkovsky's adaptation is a "drama of grief and partial recovery" concentrated upon the thoughts and the consciences of the cosmonaut scientists studying Solaris' mysterious ocean.[citation needed] In loyalty to the novel's complex and slow-paced narrative, Tarkovsky wanted to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the genre, viewing most of western science fiction as shallow.[4] The ideas which Tarkovsky tried to express in this film are further developed in Stalker (1979).</p>

At the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, it won the Grand Prix Special du Jury, the FIPRESCI prize and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.[6] The film is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinematography.</p>

The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast around the clock to billions of people around the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.</p>
			<p>The genesis of The Truman Show was a spec script by Niccol, inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone called "Special Service".[1] The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and immediately set the project up at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was in contention to direct before Weir took over and managed to make the film for $60 million against the estimated $80 million budget. Niccol rewrote the script simultaneously as the filmmakers were waiting for Carrey's schedule to open up for filming. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.</p>
			<p>The film was a financial and critical success, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as a thesis on Christianity, metaphilosophy, simulated reality, existentialism and reality television.</p>

The film was co-directed by <writer><name sort="Peterson, Bob">Bob Peterson</name></writer>, with music composed by Michael Giacchino.</p>
			<p>Docter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.</p>
			<p>Up was released on May 29, 2009 and opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first animated and 3D film to do so.[5] The film became a great financial success, accumulating over $731 million in its theatrical release. Up received universal acclaim, with most reviewers commending the humor and heart of the film. Edward Asner was praised for his portrayal of Carl, and a montage of Carl and his wife Ellie aging together was widely lauded. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination (and Pixar's first Best Picture nomination), following Beauty and the Beast (1991).[6]</p>

			<p>Vertigo is a 1958 American psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock.

The screenplay was written by <writer><name sort="Coppel, Alec">Alec Coppel</name></writer> and <actor><name sort="Taylor, Samuel A.">Samuel A. Taylor</name></actor>.</p>
			<p>The film stars <actor><name sort="Stewart, James">James Stewart</name></actor> as former police detective <actor><name sort="Ferguson, John">John Ferguson</name></actor>. Scottie is forced into early retirement because an incident in the line of duty has caused him to develop acrophobia (an extreme fear of heights) and vertigo (a sensation of false, rotational movement). Scottie is hired by an acquaintance, Gavin Elster, as a private investigator to follow Gavin's wife Madeleine (<actor><name sort="Novak, Kim">Kim Novak</name></actor>), who is behaving strangely.</p>
			<p>The film was shot on location in San Francisco, California, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. It is the first film to utilize the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia. As a result of its use in this film, the effect is often referred to as "the Vertigo effect".</p>
			<p>Vertigo received mixed reviews upon initial release, but is now often cited as a classic Hitchcock film and one of the defining works of his career. Attracting significant scholarly criticism, it replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as the best film ever made in the 2012 British Film Institute's Sight and Sound critics' poll.[2] In 1996, the film underwent a major restoration to create a new 70mm print and DTS soundtrack. It has appeared repeatedly in polls of the best films by the American Film Institute,[3] including a 2007 ranking as the ninth-greatest American movie of all time.</p>

			<p>Notable for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters, over the years it has become an icon of American popular culture. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture but lost to Gone with the Wind. It did win in two other categories including Best Original Song for "Over the Rainbow". However, the film was a box office disappointment on its initial release, earning only $3,017,000 on a $2,777,000 budget, despite receiving largely positive reviews.[1][4] It was MGM's most expensive production at that time, and did not completely recoup the studio's investment and turn a profit until theatrical re-releases starting in 1949.</p>
			<p>The 1956 broadcast television premiere of the film on CBS re-introduced the film to the wider public and eventually made the presentation an annual tradition, making it one of the most known films in cinema history.[2] The film was named the most-viewed motion picture on television syndication by the Library of Congress who also included the film in its National Film Registry in its inaugural year in 1989. Designation on the registry calls for efforts to preserve it for being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant".[6] It is also one of the few films on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register.</p>
			<p>The Wizard of Oz is often ranked on best-movie lists in critics' and public polls. It is the source of many quotes referenced in modern popular culture. It was directed primarily by Victor Fleming (who left production to take over direction on the troubled Gone with the Wind production). <writer><name sort="Langley, Noel">Noel Langley</name></writer>, <writer><name sort="Ryerson, Florence">Florence Ryerson</name></writer> and <writer><name sort="Woolf, Edgar Allan">Edgar Allan Woolf</name></writer> received credit for the screenplay, but there were uncredited contributions by others. The songs were written by Edgar "Yip" Harburg (lyrics) and Harold Arlen (music). The incidental music, based largely on the songs, was composed by Herbert Stothart, with interspersed renderings from classical composers.</p>

			<p>Chris Carter decided to make a feature film to explore the show's mythology on a wider scale, as well as appealing to non-fans.

			<p>The film premiered on June 19, 1998 in the United States, and received mixed to positive reviews from critics.

A sequel, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, was released ten years later.</p>

		<summary>
			<p>Z is a 1969 Algerian French language political thriller directed by Costa-Gavras, with a screenplay by <writer><name sort="Costa-Gravas">Gavras</name></writer> and <writer><name sort="Semprum, Jorge">Jorge Semprun</name></writer>, based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Vassilis Vassilikos. The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic Greek politician Grigoris Lambrakis in 1963. With its satirical view of Greek politics, its dark sense of humor, and its downbeat ending, the film captures the outrage about the military dictatorship that ruled Greece at the time of its making.</p>
			<p>Z stars <actor><name sort="Trintignant, Jean-Louis">Jean-Louis Trintignant</name></actor> as the investigating magistrate (an analogue of Christos Sartzetakis). International stars <actor><name sort="Montand, Yves">Yves Montand</name></actor> and <actor><name sort="Papas, Irene">Irene Papas</name></actor> also appear, but despite their star billing have very little screen time. <actor><name sort="Perrin, Jacques">Jacques Perrin</name></actor>, who co-produced, plays a key role. The film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan (Greek: ?e?, IPA: ['zi]) meaning "he lives," in reference to Lambrakis.</p>
			<p>The film had a total of 3,952,913 admissions in France and was the 4th highest grossing film of the year. It was also the 12th highest grossing film of 1969 in the U.S. Z is also one of the few films to be nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture.</p>
